# BCI - How Music Affects Retention (Brain Waves)
We conducted an experiment using the Neurosky software/hardware and Open Vibe to explore the influence of music on participants' retention rates. Our goal was to examine the effect of different music genres on their "meditation score." To analyze and present our findings, we utilized the Matplotlib library for data visualization. Additionally, we performed a t-test to determine the statistical significance of our results.

The experiment involved an eight-participant sample, and we implemented counterbalancing techniques to mitigate potential order effects. To assess retention, we employed a paired association task that exposed participants to classical music, metal music, and a control condition without any music.
